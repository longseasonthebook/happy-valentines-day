        <p>Thank you for always loving me, for caring for me, and for always being soooo patient for me despite how many
        times we've argued about us not being able to spend time pretty well, and that we haven't had much time to fix our relationship, now that it's Valentines' day today. 
        but I want to be the best for you, and I really want to prove myself to you more and more again. I want to express my love for you, and my passion for coding through this simple website I made, just for you, because I know that when I have you and coding, I'm gonna be alright! 
        No matter what argument we may come across, I will always be your teammate, your supporter, and I'll be the kare-kare to your bagoong, always! I hope that through this simple gift, you may always know that I love you, and that I value you and our relationship! 
        In the soonest possible time, I hope we can see each other again, my love! Happy Valentines day, my baba! I love you soooooo much baby!! </p> <br>
        <p>Love, your Eon, Dusty, Yoyi, Bab, hubba, your pretty boy :></p>
